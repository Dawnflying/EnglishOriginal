> 在以劳动分工为基础的市场经济中，政府机构发行货币的作用是促进商品和服务的交换。金钱使经济交换比物品经济和易货经济更有效率，避免了诸如“需求巧合”问题等此类系统的低效率

人们普遍存在一种误解，认为比特币和原生区块链代币是与各国中央银行发行的法定货币（如欧元、美元或日元）相当的货币。将代币称为“货币”引发了很多争议，但并不完全正确。虽然原生协议代币和一些资产代币具有货币的某些属性，但它们更像商品货币或代表货币，而不是现代法定货币。当我们试图解释或谈论加密令牌时，我们面临的最大挑战是我们试图用旧术语解释新现象。使用旧术语来解释新现象并不总能充分说明这项新技术必须提供的全部可能性。为了能够得出相似之处并做出准确区分，重要的是要了解货币的历史演变，以及货币的用途和功能。

货币的主要目的是促进经济体内部和经济体之间商品和服务的经济交换。它使经济交换比礼物经济和易货经济更有效率，避免了诸如“需求巧合”问题等此类系统的低效率。需求巧合问题是指拥有不同商品的两方不可能达成交易，除非双方同时想要对方提供的特定商品。为了缓解这个问题，人们可以就一种具有普遍价值的资产作为交换媒介达成一致。贝壳、贵金属或牲畜最初被用作此类资产，以应对易货经济的低效率。然而，随着时间的推移，更多中立的人工交换媒介被开发出来，我们开始将其称为货币。货币已被证明是一种有效的中介商品和服务交换的技术，提供了一种比较不同对象价值的工具。

货币需要充当交换媒介、价值储存和债务计价的记账单位。它为市场价格提供了基础，这是有效会计制度所必需的，也是制定商业协议的基础。货币是一个封闭的人群的货币系统，例如一个国家，通常在该国家/地区内充当法定货币。如果一种货币具有法定货币的地位，它就是一个国家在其法律体系中用来计价债务的单位。作为法定货币，它代表了一种公认的方式来履行因经济活动而产生的财务义务，并在该国家的地理边界内清偿债务。但是，法定货币的确切定义因司法管辖区而异。

## 货币的属性

货币的属性包括流动性、可替代性、耐用性、便携性、可识别性和稳定性。货币还需要一些内置的防伪措施来避免伪造。

**流动性**是指代表货币的基质必须易于交易，交易成本低。

**可分割性和便携性**是指资产必须易于运输。虽然一桶油是可分割且耐用的，但油在桶中并不容易携带。与一桶油相比，一条金条同样耐用，但更容易转移。然而，这种金条的分割，即熔化和铸造成更小单元的过程，成本很高。

**可替代性**指的是货币单位是相等的。该货币的每个代币都必须得到平等对待，即使它已被以前的所有者用于非法目的。这是为了保护那些可能不知道非法活动的无辜接收者的权利。如果可以根据先前代币持有者的行为审查代币或将代币列入黑名单，则无法保证可替代性。

**耐用性**是指能够承受反复使用，因此可以作为保值手段。货币必须能够可靠地保存、存储和取回，并且在取回时能够可预测地用作交换媒介。这意味着该货币的基底不应轻易消失、腐烂或腐烂。金属或耐用食品如小麦、面粉和糖具有很高的耐用性，因此经常被用作商品货币；它们对几乎所有社会成员都被认为是宝贵的，并且是解决“需求巧合”问题的一种方法。

**稳定**是指价值不应该波动太大；否则，它将无法作为可靠的价值存储。如果没有可靠的价值储存手段，个人家庭和公司以及政府的经济规划将很困难。高波动性不利于对未来价格、工资、债务乃至贸易的信任。通货膨胀降低了货币的价值，因此，它具有作为价值储存手段的能力。如果价格水平上升，每单位货币购买的商品和服务就会减少。另一方面，通货紧缩会降低商品和服务的总体价格水平。

**可识别性**是指货币代币的价值必须易于识别。

### Types of Money {#types-of-money}

### 货币类型

Different types of money have evolved over time. In modern economies, the dominant type of money is fiat money. Prior to the existence of modern day fiat currencies, commodity money and representative money were in widespread use.

随着时间的推移，出现了不同类型的货币。在现代经济中，占主导地位的货币类型是法定货币。在现代法定货币出现之前，商品货币和代表货币被广泛使用。

**商品货币** 是在当地经济中具有内在和标准化价值的任何对象。此类商品货币的价值取决于制造它的商品：金币、银币和其他稀有金属硬币、盐、大麦、动物毛皮、香烟或拉面包。在监狱禁烟之前，香烟曾被用作地下货币，但后来被金枪鱼罐头、方便面包和类似的对囚犯来说价值很高的耐用便携物品所取代。价格是通过比较商品的感知价值与其他产品的感知价值来确定的。


**代表货币**另一方面，代表货币是一种交换媒介，代表有价值的东西，但本身价值很小或没有价值。这是对商品的索赔：黄金或白银证书，或由黄金储备支持的纸币和硬币。资产代币也代表实物，可以归类为商品货币。

Fiat money is established by government regulation, similar to any check or note of debt. Fiat money, like the coins and bills we use today, do not have an intrinsic physical value like a commodity. Their face value, which is denominated on the banknote, is greater than their material substance. “It derives its value by being declared by a government to be legal tender... It must be accepted as a form of payment within the boundaries of the country, for all debts, public and private… The money supply of a country consists of currency (banknotes and coins) and, depending on the particular definition used, one or more types of bank money (the balances held in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other types of bank accounts). Bank money, which consists only of records (mostly computerized in modern banking), forms by far the largest part of broad money in developed countries.”[^2] In modern economies, most money in circulation is not in the form of bills and coins anymore, but rather an entry in the digital ledgers of a bank, managing money saved in current accounts, checking accounts, and in the form of other financial instruments. The assigned value results from the fact that governments can use their power to enforce the value of a fiat currency. 

**法定货币**是由政府监管建立的，类似于任何支票或债务票据。法定货币，就像我们今天使用的硬币和纸币一样，没有像商品那样的内在物理价值。它们在钞票上标示的面值大于它们的物理价值。
它通过被政府宣布为法定货币来获得其价值，并且必须被接受为该国境内的一种支付方式，用于所有公共和私人债务。
一个国家的货币供应包括货币（纸币和硬币），以及根据所使用的特定定义，一种或多种类型的银行货币（支票账户、储蓄账户和其他类型的银行账户中持有的余额）。银行货币仅由记录组成（在现代银行业中主要是计算机化的），是发达国家广义货币中迄今为止最大的部分。”[^2] 在现代经济中，流通中的大多数货币不是物理货币的形式，而是银行数字分类账中的一个条目，管理活期账户、支票账户和其他金融工具形式的资金。分配的价值源于这样一个事实，即政府可以使用他们的权力来强制执行法定货币的价值。

法定货币随着时间的推移而发展。虽然过去纸币和硬币与黄金和其他贵金属等稀缺商品挂钩，但金本位制被废除了。今天几乎没有任何货币与商品挂钩。中央银行通过货币政策影响货币供应，通过发行他们认为合适的信贷来发行更多或更少的货币。然而，许多经济学家会争辩说，在大多数稳定的经济体中，法定货币是由一个国家的基础经济活动的集体价值支持的，以其国内生产总值 (GDP) 衡量。


## Money or Not?

While Bitcoin was originally designed with the purpose to create P2P money without banks, the underlying P2P payment network has proven to be a gateway to a new type of economic value creation. The Bitcoin protocol is designed to incentivize individual contributions to a collective good, a public and permissionless P2P payment network. Using the vocabulary of a computer scientist, the protocol hereby provides an operating system for a new type of economy. Using the vocabulary of a political scientist, the protocol represents the constitutional foundation for a distributed Internet tribe collectively maintaining that network, a group of voluntary participants that transcends the geographical boundaries of nation states. Bitcoin tokens can be considered as the legal tender of the Bitcoin network; Bitcoin tokens are the only accepted form of payment within the network. BTC is needed to pay for transaction costs in the network. They cannot be paid with fiat money like USD, EUR, or other cryptographic tokens. The price of the network token should reflect the stability of the payment network, similar to how the value of fiat currencies should reflect the economic activities of a country.

虽然比特币最初的设计目的是在没有银行的情况下创造 P2P 货币，但底层的 P2P 支付网络已被证明是通往新型经济价值创造的门户。比特币协议旨在激励个人为集体利益做出贡献，这是一个公共且无需许可的 P2P 支付网络。使用计算机科学家的词汇，该协议特此为新型经济提供操作系统。使用政治学家的词汇，该协议代表了分布式互联网部落共同维护该网络的宪法基础，一群自愿参与者超越了国家的地理边界。比特币代币可以被视为比特币网络的法定货币；比特币代币是网络中唯一接受的支付方式。需要比特币来支付网络中的交易费用。他们不能用美元、欧元或其他加密代币等法定货币支付。网络代币的价格应该反映支付网络的稳定性，类似于法定货币的价值应该如何反映一个国家的经济活动。

Protocol tokens have certain properties of money, however, they seem to have more similarities to commodity money or representative money than to fiat money. The production process is distributed (similar to real life commodities) and the price is determined by supply and demand, thus subject to fluctuation (much like the price of tokens, which are determined by the supply and demand on exchanges). As opposed to fiat currencies, no single centralized entity like governments and central banks can influence the price or the accessibility of protocol tokens. Control is therefore distributed, much like with commodities, where no single government or other entity controls the mining of gold, silver, oil, etc. Who has how much control in the system is subject to the token creation rules defined in the protocol. The token creation and supply policy (monetary policy of the network) is the point of centralization that can only be changed by majority consensus of all network actors in the form of a software upgrade. The protocol therefore has functions of a central bank. Potential “central bank smart contracts” could account for more adaptive monetary policy than the one Bitcoin network provides. Such trends to make the monetary policy of a token more adaptive and stable are emerging (read more: Part 3 - Stable Tokens).

协议代币具有货币的某些属性，但是，与法定货币相比，它们似乎与商品货币或代表货币有更多相似之处。生产过程是分布式的（类似于现实生活中的商品），价格由供求关系决定，因此会波动（很像代币的价格，由交易所的供求关系决定）。与法定货币相反，没有像政府和中央银行这样的单一中心化实体可以影响协议代币的价格或可访问性。因此，控制是分布式的，就像商品一样，没有一个政府或其他实体控制金、银、石油等的开采。谁在系统中拥有多少控制权取决于协议中定义的代币创建规则。令牌创建和供应政策（网络的货币政策）是集中点，只能通过软件升级的形式由所有网络参与者的多数共识来改变。因此，该协议具有中央银行的功能。潜在的“中央银行智能合约”可以解释比单一比特币网络提供的更具适应性的货币政策。这种使代币的货币政策更具适应性和稳定性的趋势正在出现（阅读更多：第 3 部分 - 稳定的代币）。


While distributed production and control applies to protocol tokens, it is not necessarily true for application tokens. Application tokens or sidechain tokens are often issued by one centralized entity, a private company or a foundation. Tokens that are pegged to an asset, or a security, could also have similarities to commodity money. As opposed to commodities that are already being traded on legacy systems, asset tokens might provide much higher liquidity due to the frictionless settlement infrastructure a distributed ledger provides. This could be especially true for asset tokens that represent real life assets that currently do not have high market liquidity, or goods that hardly have a market at all. Asset tokens make the underlying asset more tradable, while the asset itself is still illiquid. Tokenization of assets can convert previously “non-bankable funds” into “bankable funds.”   Non-bankable funds are assets that are not accepted as a method of payment in a bank. Bankable funds are forms of payment that are accepted at financial institutions and easily liquidated into local currencies such as checks and money orders. They can be converted into cash with short notice and are generally accepted by merchants as a method of payment. In light of potential widespread tokenization, any tokenized asset could receive the status of a “bankable fund.” Such developments could make any tokenized asset a potential medium of exchange. However, as of today, most tokens do not fulfill some important properties of money: stability, and to some extent, also fungibility. Furthermore, usability and scalability are also entry barriers to potential mass adoption.

虽然分布式生产和控制适用于协议令牌，但它不一定适用于应用程序令牌。应用代币或侧链代币通常由一个中心化实体、一家私营公司或基金会发行。与资产或证券挂钩的代币也可能与商品货币有相似之处。与已经在遗留系统上交易的商品相反，由于分布式账本提供的无摩擦结算基础设施，资产代币可能会提供更高的流动性。对于代表目前市场流动性不高的现实资产或几乎没有市场的商品的资产代币尤其如此。资产代币使标的资产更具可交易性，而资产本身仍然缺乏流动性。资产的标记化可以将以前的“非银行资金”转换为“银行资金”。非银行资金是不被银行接受为支付方式的资产。银行存款是金融机构接受的支付方式，可以很容易地清算成当地货币，例如支票和汇票。它们可以在短时间内转换成现金，并被商家普遍接受作为一种支付方式。鉴于潜在的广泛代币化，任何代币化资产都可以获得“可融资基金”的地位。这样的发展可以使任何代币化资产成为潜在的交换媒介。然而，时至今日，大多数代币并不具备货币的一些重要属性：稳定性，以及在某种程度上的可替代性。此外，可用性和可扩展性也是潜在大规模采用的进入障碍。


* **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Stability</span>**: Bitcoin and similar blockchain protocols simply regulate and limit the amount of tokens minted over time. Their protocols do not provide a sophisticated economic algorithm that guarantees price stability; their exchange rate is determined by supply and demand on markets and is often highly volatile. While fiat currencies of most modern economies also have fluctuating exchange rates that are determined on foreign exchange markets, national institutions can perform currency intervention via foreign exchange markets or other currency manipulation. In such an intervention process, governments or central banks buy and sell currency in exchange for their own currency to manipulate the market price. They do that in order to avoid excessive short-term volatility, which makes economic actions hard to plan. Short-term volatility also tends to erode market confidence, generating extra costs and reducing the profits of firms, forcing investors to make investments in foreign financial assets. With the emergence of hedging options, stable tokens (read more: Part 3 - Stable Tokens), and atomic swaps (read more: Part 3 - Decentralized Exchanges & Atomic Swaps) on the rise, price volatility might be a non-issue in the future. However, it is unclear whether, how, and when these solutions will gain traction.

稳定性：比特币和类似的区块链协议只是调节和限制随时间铸造的代币数量。他们的协议不提供保证价格稳定的复杂经济算法；它们的汇率取决于市场的供求关系，而且往往波动很大。虽然大多数现代经济体的法定货币也有由外汇市场决定的波动汇率，但国家机构可以通过外汇市场或其他货币操纵进行货币干预。在这样的干预过程中，政府或中央银行通过买卖货币换取本国货币来操纵市场价格。他们这样做是为了避免过度的短期波动，这使得经济行动难以规划。短期波动也往往会削弱市场信心，产生额外成本并减少公司利润，迫使投资者投资于外国金融资产。随着对冲期权、稳定代币（阅读更多：第 3 部分 - 稳定代币）和原子互换（阅读更多：第 3 部分 - 去中心化交易所和原子互换）的兴起，价格波动可能不是问题未来。但是，尚不清楚这些解决方案是否、如何以及何时会受到关注。


* **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Privacy</span>**: Most tokens today have no inbuilt privacy by design. This makes them non-fungible, and therefore non-usable as a medium of exchange. For a token to potentially serve as a medium of exchange, it needs to be fully fungible. If you can taint addresses, as in the case of Bitcoin, the token will not serve as a medium of exchange in the long run. Even though Bitcoin addresses are pseudonymous, simple chain analysis of the ledger can link the data flow from a particular address with other data points outside the blockchain, and identify who is behind a Bitcoin address. While this  requires time and effort, and access to other data points, it is not unfeasible. Potential traceability destroys the fungibility of a token (read more: Part  3 -  Privacy Tokens).

隐私：今天的大多数代币在设计上都没有内置隐私。这使得它们不可替代，因此不能用作交换媒介。对于可能用作交换媒介的代币，它需要完全可替代。如果你可以污染地址，就像比特币一样，从长远来看，令牌将不会作为交换媒介。尽管比特币地址是匿名的，但对账本进行简单的链分析可以将来自特定地址的数据流与区块链外部的其他数据点联系起来，并识别出比特币地址背后的人。虽然这需要时间和精力，并且需要访问其他数据点，但这并非不可行。潜在的可追溯性破坏了令牌的可替代性（阅读更多：第 3 部分 - 隐私令牌）。


* **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Scalability:</span>** Current settlement infrastructures of public blockchain networks are secure but not very scalable. Alternative distributed ledger solutions have better scalability but tend to be more centralized. This is due to the “scalability trilemma,” the trade-off between security, scalability, and decentralization. While scalability is still a big issue, many solutions are already on the horizon (read more: Annex - Scalability). 

可扩展性：公共区块链网络的当前结算基础设施是安全的，但可扩展性不强。替代分布式账本解决方案具有更好的可扩展性，但往往更加集中。这是由于“可扩展性三难困境”，即安全性、可扩展性和去中心化之间的权衡。虽然可伸缩性仍然是一个大问题，但许多解决方案已经出现（阅读更多：附件 - 可伸缩性）。


* **<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Usability</span>**: Wallet usability also still has a long way to go. Most current wallets support only a handful of tokens, some only one. This means that you often need a separate wallet application for each token, or type of tokens. Furthermore, key management is a nightmare: if you lose your key, you lose access to your funds. If that issue is not resolved, hosted wallets in the custody of trusted third parties, such as online exchanges, will become mainstream. This, however, would undermine the efforts of autonomous asset management in the sense of P2P electronic cash, as originally envisioned by Satoshi Nakamoto.

可用性：钱包的可用性还有很长的路要走。目前大多数钱包只支持少数几种代币，有些只支持一种。这意味着您通常需要为每个令牌或令牌类型使用单独的钱包应用程序。此外，密钥管理是一场噩梦：如果您丢失了密钥，您将无法使用您的资金。如果这个问题得不到解决，由受信任的第三方托管的托管钱包（例如在线交易所）将成为主流。然而，这将破坏中本聪最初设想的 P2P 电子现金意义上的自主资产管理的努力。

## Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Toward a Digital Barter Economy

## 去中心化金融（DeFi）：迈向数字易货经济

Cryptographic tokens represent a new heterogenous asset class that can fulfill a diverse range of economic functions. Their frictionless issuance and settlement process could potentially convert many assets or access rights of the real world into “bankable funds.” Tokenizing economic activities, from real assets to digital assets and all types of access rights, could impact the role of central bank money as a geographical monopolist providing a medium of exchange, once mass adoption of the Web3 manifests and necessary network effects kick in. The speed at which these tokens are being issued is an indicator that a new tokenized economic system is emerging (read more: Part 2 - Tokens & Part 4 - Token Use Cases). Such tokenization of the real economy could gradually lead to the merging of the money system, with the financial system and the real economy. 

A range of easy-to-use decentralized financial (DeFi) applications have been emerging beyond simple payments networks that facilitate frictional and P2P asset issuance, trading, lending and hedging. The term “DeFi” encompasses any decentralized and permissionless financial application that builds on top of distributed ledgers, including privacy-preserving payment systems (privacy tokens), stability preserving payment systems (stable tokens), P2P exchanges (token exchanges), P2P fundraising (token sales), and P2P credit and lending (decentralized lending), P2P insurance, and a growing list of P2P derivatives. These Web3-based DeFi applications could, potentially, open traditional financial services to the general public, mitigating current inefficiencies of financial markets. 

The current financial system, even in it’s electronic form, requires a range of intermediary services for (i) mitigating counterparty risk, (ii) market making, and (iii) securing funds from being stolen. This is a result of the server-centric nature of the current Internet. In a tokenized economy, however, distributed ledgers and user-centric identity solutions could increase ecosystem transparency, accountability, and market efficiency:

* Due to the public nature of distributed ledgers, DeFi applications are designed to be globally accessible by anyone around the world with an Internet connection and a Web3 wallet. Once the smart contract is deployed, DeFi applications self-execute with little institutional intervention except for code upgrades, bug fixes, and dispute resolution. 

* If users choose “non-custodial” wallet solutions, they remain in possession of the private keys and in full control of the funds, potentially disintermediating many financial services that currently provide services to mitigate counterparty risk, act as market makers, or secure funds from being stolen.

* Any smart contract code can be audited by anyone and is subject to collective loophole fixing, which is the basis for the rapidly evolving DeFi ecosystem.

* All token transactions are publicly verifiable, reducing market friction and increasing the interoperability of financial services. As a result of such interoperability, DeFi applications can be built in a modular way, which is why many refer to them as “money legos.” 

Combining various DeFi solutions, such as “stable tokens,” “decentralized exchanges,” and “decentralized lending,” can produce completely new products available to retail investors and the general public. Any private person could, in such a setup, tokenize their real assets and use them as collateral for P2P lending solutions without bureaucracy by using a combination of simple DeFi applications (read more: Part 3 - Decentralized Lending). Such new services could, in the long run, change the dynamics of our economic system and contribute to the merging of the real economy and the financial system, making their distinction increasingly impossible.

While such “money legos” are quickly emerging, they are still nascent and often prone to exploits and attacks as a result of unintended programming mistakes and malicious hacks. The governance/business logic of the underlying smart contracts needs extensive auditing and bug fixing, especially in light of a growing and complex network of interoperable DeFi applications (read more: Chapter 3 - Token Lending). Furthermore, most DeFi applications today are built for developers, not for users. Their current lack of usability undermines decentralization efforts. However, once the user experience improves, and user-centric identities become mainstream, any non-bankable funds could be managed by a public infrastructure and converted into a financial product that can be easily used as collateral or traded with a simple mobile wallet where you are in full control of all your assets and all your data (read more: Part 1 - User-Centric Identities).

Many economists remain skeptical that cryptographic tokens can permanently replace conventional currencies since: (i) There are strong network externalities that favor existing conventional currencies; (ii) The lack of sophisticated token supply rules leading to socially desirable stability and liquidity of tokenized economies. Furthermore, (iii) from a classic economic perspective, it seems impossible to pre-specify socially optimal “lender-of-last resort”  rules in a smart contract. Lender-of-last resort refers to a safety-net institution, usually provided by central banks, to reduce the risk of a lack of liquidity of financial systems as a result of financial panics and bank runs. It represents government-guaranteed liquidity to financial institutions. The lack of such a lender-of-last resort makes financial systems susceptible to financial crises and systemic panics.

I would like to argue that we are still in the very early stages of a tokenized economy. I am confident that economic methods and practices will find their way into the smart contracts and token governance rules of future token systems. We can already see this happening in the cases of algorithmic stable tokens. Furthermore, many central banks are currently looking into or have already started to tokenize central bank currencies (Central Bank Digital Currencies) and make them distributed ledger compatible (read more: Part 3 - Stable Tokens).  New legal frameworks will be needed as these new structures transition from an early innovation phase to a more mature infrastructure phase. 

One important bottleneck will be the emergence of multi-token capability of wallets and better key recovery solutions (read more: Part 1 - Token Security, Wallets). Another bottleneck will be overcoming the challenge of token trading through the inefficiency of centralized exchanges. Once P2P swapping of tokens matures and is adopted by wallet software, anyone will be able to exchange any token P2P, wallet to wallet, without any intermediary (read more: Part 3 - Trading Tokens, Atomic Swaps & DEX). In such a future scenario, powered by AI and DeFi applications, atomic swaps could potentially introduce a tokenized barter economy powered by global trading platforms, without the coincidence-of-wants problem we face today.

### Chapter Summary

> In a market economy based on division of labor and money issued by governmental bodies, the role of money is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. It makes economic exchange much more efficient than gift economies and barter economies, avoiding the inefficiencies of such systems like the “coincidence of wants” problem.

> Money proved to be an efficient tool for comparing values of different goods and services. It has different functions and properties. It acts as a (i) medium of exchange; (ii) measure of value and unit of account in which debt can be denominated; and as a (iii) store of value.

> Properties of money include (i) liquidity, (ii) fungibility, (iii) durability, (iv) portability, (v) cognizability, and (vi) stability. It also needs some (vii) inbuilt anti-counterfeiting measures to avoid forging. Different types of money have evolved over time.

> In modern economies, the dominant type of money is so-called (i) fiat currency. Prior to the existence of modern day fiat currencies, we had (ii) commodity money and (iii) representative money.

> Protocol tokens like Bitcoin or Ether are needed to pay for transactions in their respective networks. They represent the “legal tender” of the network, which is needed to pay for network services. The Bitcoin network is a public infrastructure for “P2P remittances.” Transaction fees for these remittances need to be paid with BTC tokens. 

> As of today, most tokens do not fulfill one of the most important properties of money: stability of value, and to some extent, also fungibility. Usability and scalability are other entry barriers to potential mass adoption.

> Cryptographic tokens represent a new heterogenous asset class that can fulfill a diverse range of economic functions. Their frictionless issuance and settlement process could potentially convert many assets or access rights of the real world into “bankable funds.” 

> It is likely that tokenizing economic activities, from real assets to digital assets and all types of access rights, will impact the role of central bank money as a geographical monopolist providing a medium of exchange in the long run.
