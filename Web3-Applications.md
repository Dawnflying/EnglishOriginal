The first chapter explains how smart contracts can encode and algorithmically enforce the business logic or governance rules of simple or complex agreements. The following two chapters will shed light on the institutional economics and governance aspects of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations, the most complex form of a smart contract that are steered by purpose-driven tokens. The last chapter will introduce tokens as the atomic unit of the Web3 and dive into the history, definition, and properties of different types of tokens.
