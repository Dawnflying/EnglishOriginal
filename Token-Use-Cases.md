This part will deep-dive into a selection of token use cases and industries that might be disrupted as a result of tokenization. While some of the outlined use cases are already operational, many are still in a conceptual phase. To cover a range of topics, each chapter has been kept compact, describing the issues at hand on a high level. For a deep-dive, the references at the end of each chapter might be useful for further reading on each topic. The last chapter will give a practical guideline on how to design your own token system.
